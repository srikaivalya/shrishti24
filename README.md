This project aims to effectively manage the number of passengers boarding and disembarking a bus through the utilization of YOLO object detection technology.

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, safety measures are paramount, necessitating a strict adherence to passenger capacity limits. To this end, the bus service has established a maximum capacity threshold, ensuring adequate spacing between passengers and mitigating the risk of overcrowding. With a set limit in place, the bus will not permit additional passengers to board once the count reaches the specified capacity. This proactive approach underscores the commitment to safeguarding the health and well-being of both passengers and transit staff, aligning with public health directives and fostering a culture of responsible management during these challenging times.
